# Introduction
Graphs are data structures composed of nodes and edges

- nodes/vertexes are denoted as $V=\{v_1,v_2,...,v_n\}$
- edges are denoted as $E=\{e_1,e_2,...,e_n\}$

Graph analytics is the process of analyzing relationships between vertexes and edges.

Graphs are called **undirected** if edges do not have a direction, otherwise they are called **directed** graphs. Vertexes and edges can have data associated with them

- weights are associated to edges (e.g., they may represent the strength of the relationship);
- labels are associated to vertexes (e.g., they may be the string associated with the name of the vertex).

## Why graph analytics?
Graphs are natural way of describing relationships. Some practical example of analytics over graphs

# Spark GraphX and GraphFrames
## GraphX
GraphX is the Spark RDD-based library for performing graph processing. It is a core part of Spark.

GraphX

- is low level interface with RDD
- is very powerful: many application and libraries built on top of it
- is not easy to use or optimize
- has no Python version of the APIs
