# Who generates Big Data
- User generated content: social networks (web and mobile)
- Health and scientific computing
- Log files: web server log files, machine system log files
- Internet of Things (IoT): sensor networks, RFIDs, smart meters

## Example of Big Data at work

# The five Vs of Big Data
- Volume: scale of data
- Variety: different forms of data
- Velocity: analysis of streaming data
- Veracity: uncertainty of data
- Value: exploit information provided by data

# The bottleneck and the solution
## Bottleneck
- Processors process data
- Hard drives store data
- We need to transfer data from the disk to the processor

## Solution
- Transfer the processing power to the data
- Multiple distributed disks: each one holding a portion of a large dataset
- Process in parallel different file portions from different disks
