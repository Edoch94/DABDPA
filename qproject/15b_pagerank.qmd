# Introduction to PageRank
PageRank is the original famous algorithm used by the Google Search engine to rank vertexes (web pages) in a graph by order of importance. For the Google search engine, vertexes are web pages in the World Wide Web, and edges are hyperlinks among web pages: PageRank works by assigning a numerical weighting (importance) to each node.

In other words, it computes a likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular web page. So, to have a high PageRank, it is important to have many in-links, and be liked by relevant pages (pages characterized by a high PageRank).

### Basic idea
- The vote of each link is proportional to the importance of its source page $p$;
- If page $p$ with importance $\textbf{PageRank}(p)$ has $n$ out-links, each out-link gets $\frac{\textbf{PageRank}(p)}{n}$ votes;
- Page $p$ importance is the sum of the votes on its in-links.

## PageRank formulations
### Simple recursive formulation
- Initialize each page rank to $1.0$: for each $p$ in pages set $\textbf{PageRank}(p)$ to $1.0$
- Iterate for $max$ iterations
    1. Page $p$ sends a contribution $\frac{\textbf{PageRank}(p)}{\textbf{numOutLinks}(p)}$ to its neighbors (the pages it links);
    2. Update each page rank $\textbf{PageRank}(p)$ with the sum of the received contributions.

### Random jumps formulation
The PageRank algorithm simulates the "random walk" of a user on the web. Indeed, at each step of the random walk, the random surfer has two options:

- with probability $1-\alpha$, follow a link at random among the ones in the current page;
- with probability $\alpha$, jump to a random page.

- Initialize each page rank to $1.0$: for each $p$ in pages set $\textbf{PageRank}(p)$ to $1.0$
- Iterate for max iterations
    1. Page $p$ sends a contribution $\frac{\textbf{PageRank}(p)}{\textbf{numOutLinks}(p)}$ to its neighbors (the pages it links);
    2. Update each page rank $\textbf{PageRank}(p)$ to $\alpha + (1 - \alpha)$ **times** the sum of the received contributions.

### Example
- $\alpha=0.15$
- Initialization: $\forall{p}, \textbf{PageRank}(p) = 1.0$
